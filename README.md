<img src="busicon.jpg" width='200'/>

## Description
This real-time bus tracker allows users to view bus stops between MIT and Harvard University. It utilizes MapBox, an open-source site that allows registered users to create and display maps on their own web pages. This exercise utilizes asychronous coding in JavaScript. 
## Instructions
Before running this program, you must create a free account on MapBox and get an access token. Then, you must paste that token in the mapanimation.js file, where the code is labeled "ADD TOKEN HERE." After adding the access token, load the index.html file. Click the "Show Stops" button to begin the animation. 
## Roadmap
Future changes may include using data for a different city.
